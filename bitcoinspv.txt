ZeusNode Guardian locked the bitcoin and turned it into zBTC.

$zBTC represents a revolutionary solution catering to Bitcoin holders and developers seeking to engage with smart contracts on Solana.

Key features of $zBTC include
Permissionless and Uncensored: Participation and interaction with $zBTC are open to all, devoid of any centralized entity exercising custody over BTC.

1:1 Price Pegged: Maintains a constant exchange ratio of 1:1 with BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring seamless interoperability.

Flexibility and Accessibility: Opportunity to participate in DeFi strategies and leverage Bitcoin assets for potential earnings.

The potential applications of $zBTC within the Solana ecosystem are vast, including:


Depositing $zBTC into DeFi protocols to earn yields.

Liquidity Provider for $zBTC earning LP fees.

Swapping $zBTC for any SPL token.

Collateralizing $zBTC to create stablecoins.

And more...

To create a pump.fun token we only need to swap the $zBTC which we are the first one to do it in order to create a solana token, once the mainet explorer is live, u can check here:
